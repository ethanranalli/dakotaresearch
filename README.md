# Dakota Research Website

This repository contains the static website for Dakota Research. The site is built with simple HTML and CSS and includes three pages:

- **Home** (`index.html`)
- **About** (`about.html`)
- **Contact** (`contact.html`)

Open `index.html` in a web browser to view the site locally.

Smooth scrolling and fade-in animations are included using CSS and a small JavaScript helper. These enhance navigation between sections and reveal content gently as you scroll.
